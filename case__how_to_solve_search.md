> I have a bunch of markdown files in hugo. How could I generate an index.json with hugo for fuse.js search library to use in the browser, so that it would include all generated documents and each subtitle in each document would be it's own item in the index.json and would provide a title (document > anchor), and url and a anchor into the index.json file so search library could use it to link to it directly then.

You can achieve this using a combination of Hugo's built-in functions and a custom output format. Here's a breakdown of the process and a working example:

1. **Create a Data Template:**

   Create a file named `search-index.json` in your `data` directory (e.g., `data/search-index.json`).  This template will generate the JSON data.

   ```json
   {{ $searchIndex := slice }}
   {{ range .Site.Pages }}
     {{ $permalink := .Permalink }}
     {{ $title := .Title }}

     {{ $searchIndex = $searchIndex | append (dict "title" $title "url" $permalink "anchor" "" ) }} {{/* Add the main page title */}}

     {{ range .TableOfContents.Entries }}
       {{ $anchor := .Anchor }}
       {{ $subtitle := .Title }}
       {{ $searchIndex = $searchIndex | append (dict "title" (printf "%s > %s" $title $subtitle) "url" $permalink "anchor" $anchor) }}
     {{ end }}

   {{ end }}

   {{ json $searchIndex }}
   ```

2. **Configure Output Format:**

   In your `config.toml` (or `config.yaml`), add the following output configuration:

   ```toml
   [outputs]
     home = ["HTML", "RSS", "JSON"]
     page = ["HTML", "RSS"]

     [outputs.data.search-index]
       mediaType = "application/json"
       path = "search-index.json" # Output path for the JSON file
       isPlainText = true # For proper JSON formatting (important!)

   ```

   This configuration tells Hugo to treat `search-index.json` as a data file, render it as JSON, and save it to `public/search-index.json` during the build process.  The `isPlainText = true` setting is crucial; without it, Hugo might escape HTML characters in your JSON, breaking the search functionality.

3. **Accessing the JSON in your JavaScript:**

   In your client-side JavaScript, you can fetch and use the generated `search-index.json` with Fuse.js:

   ```javascript
   fetch('/search-index.json')
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(searchIndex => {
       const options = { // Fuse.js options
         keys: ['title'],
         includeMatches: true, // To highlight matches
         threshold: 0.3, // Adjust as needed
       };

       const fuse = new Fuse(searchIndex, options);

       // Example search functionality:
       const searchTerm = 'Introduction'; // Get search term from user input
       const results = fuse.search(searchTerm);

       results.forEach(result => {
         const { item, matches } = result;
         const title = item.title;
         const url = item.url + (item.anchor ? `#${item.anchor}` : ''); // Construct URL with anchor

         // Create search result links in your UI
         const link = document.createElement('a');
         link.href = url;
         link.textContent = title; 
         // ... add link to your search results container ...

          // ... highlight matched text using 'matches' ... (See Fuse.js docs for details)
       });
     });
   ```

**Explanation:**

* The data template iterates through all pages and their table of contents entries, creating a structured JSON object with title, URL, and anchor information.
* The `printf` function formats the title to include both the document title and the subtitle.
* The JavaScript code fetches the JSON, initializes Fuse.js, performs searches, and dynamically creates links with the correct URLs and anchors.
* The `isPlainText = true` ensures the JSON data isn't HTML-escaped.


This approach generates a single `search-index.json` file containing all the data Fuse.js needs for efficient client-side searching, allowing direct linking to specific sections within your Hugo pages. Remember to adjust the Fuse.js options (like `keys` and `threshold`) to fine-tune your search behavior.
